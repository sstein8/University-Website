This website is the academic hub for students of Zoom University. There are two main features of the website, the registration side and the advising side. The site begins at a login page where anyone affiliated with the university can log in. This includes graduate students, faculty, graduate secretaries, and the system administrator. When an individual logs in, they are presented with a homepage that has buttons that direct them to either the advising features or the registration features.

On the registration side, depending on the role of the individual, different options will appear to them. For example, students have access to a course registration page where they can add and drop courses from their schedule. A faculty member, grad secretary, or system administrator would not have this feature presented to them since they do not need to register for courses. A feature that is available to everyone is the course catalog, which lists all of the courses that the school offers, not necessarily for a certain semester or year. There is information provided about each course such as prerequisites and course descriptions. A feature available to faculty, grad secretaries, and system administrators is the transcript lookup and grading feature. Faculty members can see a schedule of all the courses they have taught, or are currently teaching, and for each class, they can view a roster of all of the students along with their transcripts. Faculty members can input a grade for a student on this page, but cannot change it. The grad secretary is presented with the same features, but has access to every student’s grades and can overwrite grades that a professor put in. This is similar for the system admin. They can look up courses by the year they were offered, and from there, have similar functionality for changing and viewing grades. Some other features unique to the system admin are creating new users (of any role), and adding new courses to the course catalog for students to register for.

On the advising side, only certain users have access to certain advising features. The graduate students in the masters program can view and edit their personal information, check if they meet all of the qualifications to graduate, view their transcripts as well as submit a form1 so their advisors can see it. The PHD students have basically the same functions, but they also can submit their thesis for faculty advisor approval as well as all of the functionality that the master's student has as well. The faculty advisor can view their students’ form 1 submission, view student transcripts, see their advisees, and approve PHD theses. The grad secretary can assign faculty advisors to students, approve students for graduation, and view student data and transcripts as well. The system admin can view student data and transcripts on the advising side as well. Everyone regardless of who they are can see the course catalog since it is helpful to students when filling out form 1 and for advisors when viewing graduation requirements. Alumni can also view their personal information and update it, as well as view their final transcript.
